## UPDATE:
* The application.yml file is now set to use the configuration from the .env file.
* To make this work, the .env file needs to be in the root directory of the project.

This is my initial journey in learning Spring Boot. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* JDK 17 or higher
* Maven
* VS Code
* Docker
* Docker Compose

This introduces the basics including the use of annotations, Spring Boot, and Spring Data JPA. 

The following annotations are used:
* `@SpringBootApplication`
* `@Entity`
* `@Id`
* `@GeneratedValue`
* `@Table`
* `@Column`
* `@OneToMany`
* `@ManyToOne`
